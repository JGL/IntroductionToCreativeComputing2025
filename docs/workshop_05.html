  <div>
    This morning we are going to complete three exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. As I said yesterday and the day before, I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>
    This morning we are going to have 10 minutes for the first exercise, with 40 minutes for each of the last two exercises.
  </div>
  <div>A reminder from yesterday: make these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js editor at https://editor.p5js.org</a> - easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Colour Observation" before we all try it on our own on the p5.js editor. Any suggestions? Show the PDF Joel!
  </div>
  <div>
    Next, let's spend 40 minutes on the "Living Line I" exercise. What should we use to remember all the previous positions of the line? Show the PDF Joel!
  </div>
  <div>
    Finally we have 40 minutes for the "Ripples in a Pond" exercise. What new programming paradigm could we use for this exercise? Show the PDF Joel!
  </div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
