  <div>
    This afternoon we are going to complete three exercises from <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/code-creative-medium">Code as a Creative Medium</a>, which was written by <a href="http://tegabrain.com">Tega Brain</a> and <a href=" http://golanlevin.com">Golan Levin</a>. As I said yesterday, the day before and the day before that, I'd really recommend picking up a copy if you can, it's full of brilliant reference, exercises and project briefs.
  </div>
  <div>
    This afternoon we are going to have 40 mintes for each exercise.
  </div>
  <div>A reminder from yesterday, the day before and the day before that: make these exercises on the <a href="https://editor.p5js.org">online p5.js editor at https://editor.p5js.org</a> - easier for sharing with others and a nice way of building up a portfolio of p5.js sketches.</div>
  <div>
    Let's discuss "Colour of a Pixel" before we all try it on our own on the p5.js editor. Any suggestions? We have 40 minutes for this exercise. Show the PDF Joel!

    Finally, let's discuss "Searching for the Brightest Point" before we all try it on our own on the p5.js editor. Any suggestions? We have 40 minutes for this exercise. Show the PDF Joel!

    Thanks! Time for a short break!
