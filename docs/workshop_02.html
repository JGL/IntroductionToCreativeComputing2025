    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: 🪞: Workshop 2: Binary <-> Decimal. CamelCase. Converting between types. Data Self Portraits.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>By the end of this workshop, we'll have covered:
    <ul>
      <li>Converting between Binary and Decimal numbers</li>
      <li>What CamelCase is and why it's important to use it when naming variables</li>
      <li>How to convert between types in JavaScript</li>
      <li>Made Data Self Portraits</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>20 minutes: Converting between Binary and Decimal numbers</div>
  <div>How would you convert between a binary number and a decimal number?</div>
  <div>You could <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=binary+to+decimal+converter">DuckDuckGo it</a>! Or Google it.</div>
  <div>Let's go through converting 42 from decimal to binary.</div>
  <div>Let's go through converting 101011 from binary to decimal.</div>
  <div>I'd like you to convert 71 from decimal to binary, manually! Type your answer into the chat when you have the answer.</div>
  <div>I'd like you to convert 10011 from binary to decimal, manually! Type your answer into the chat when you have the answer.</div>
  <div>Any questions?</div>
  <div>10 minutes: What CamelCase is and why it's important to use it when naming variables</div>
  <div>10 minutes: What is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case">CamelCase</a>? Why might it be important to use when naming your variables?</div>

  <div>Any questions?</div>
  <div>30 minutes: Code based Data Self Portraits</div>
  <div>The exercise we are about to do was inspired by <a href="http://www.dear-data.com/theproject">Dear Data</a>, a project by <a href="http://www.stefanieposavec.com/">Stefanie Posavec</a> and <a href="http://giorgialupi.com">Giorgia Lupi</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/giorgia_lupi_how_we_can_find_ourselves_in_data/">a great TED talk about it by Giorgia</a>, and <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/how-to-draw-your-own-selfie-using-your-personal-data/">instructions on how to draw your own data selfie</a>.</div>
  <div>Here is my code based Data Self Portrait, in JavaScript:
    <pre>
      let fullName = "Joel Gethin Lewis";
      let currentAge = 41;
      let isLeftHanded = true;
      let numberOfBirthmarks = 1;
      let heightInCM = 182.88;
      let weightInKG = 82.8;
    </pre>
    You have 20 minutes to make your own Data Self Portraits. Go!
  </div>
  <div>Let's share them! How would you visualise them?</div>
  <div>Any questions?</div>
  <div>
    Thanks! Time for a short break!
