    UAL CCI: Introduction to Creative Computing Intensive 2022: üì• & üìö: Lecture 10: State Machines and Libraries.<br /><a href="index.html">Back to slide index</a>.
  </div>
  <div>To start with today, I'd like to talk about a way of thinking about your programs that really helped me to scale from single page sketches up to large projects. I've found it helpful to think of my projects as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machines</a>. We'll take a look at the definition in a moment, but the main thing I want you to take from the idea is that your program now can only exist in a several states, and transform between them.</div>
  <div>How to add other libraries of JavaScript code to your p5.js projects, and some of the most interesting ones I've used in my work.</div>
  <div>What is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">software library</a>?</div>
  <div>One thing to realise is that <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js is a library itself</a>!</div>
  <div>p5.js has <a href="https://p5js.org/libraries/">many libraries, some core and some contributed</a>. Let's take a look at them. First, let's look at <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.sound</a>, a core library of p5.js. All of those examples are included on the online p5js editor too, just type sound to only show those examples when you use File > Examples. For reference, <a href="https://therewasaguy.github.io/p5-music-viz/">check out these music visualisation examples, which all use the p5.sound library</a>.</div>
  <div>Another library (a contributed one this time) I wanted to highlight one that is kind of state machine-like: <a href="https://github.com/mveteanu/p5.SceneManager">p5.js Scene Manager</a>. Another I love is <a href="http://molleindustria.github.io/p5.play/">p5.play</a>, which is designed for the creation of games and other playthings.</div>
  <div>Do you remember that falling logo I showed you in a previous lecture? <a href="https://jgl.github.io/DesignAgainstCrimeIdentity/">Let's take a look at how it includes other libraries apart from p5.js</a> - <a href="https://github.com/bitcraftlab/p5.gui">p5.gui</a> and <a href="https://brm.io/matter-js/">matter.js</a>. Making GUI's for your sketches is a great idea because you can use that GUI to quickly tweak settings and the like - to explore the "possibility space" of your code. I love using physics simulations to animate with because I'm too lazy to do keyframe animation.</div>
  <div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5wpm-gesOY">Any programmer will tell you that dealing with date and time and timezones is a nightmare</a> - I've used <a href="https://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> several times in my projects, particuarly <a href="https://github.com/JGL/LenticularFun/blob/master/docs/05_lenticularPrinterWithDOMInterface/sketch.js#L160">to generate nice filenames</a>.</div>
  <div>Let's finish with a quick tour through some other JavaScript libraries that might be useful.</div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://paperjs.org/">Paper.js - vector graphics library</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://two.js.org">Two.js - another vector graphics library</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://google.github.io/liquidfun/">LiquidFun - fluid simulation library</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://zzz.dog/">Zdog - round, flat, designer-friendly pseudo-3D engine</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://ptsjs.org/">Pts - linear algebra libary</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js - 3D graphics library</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://leafletjs.com/">leaflet.js - map and location library</a>.</li>
      <li><a href="https://hammerjs.github.io/">hammer.js - touch gesture library</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>Finally, two interesting quotes from two of my favourite artists and a final thought on practice.</div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/anni-albers">Anni
      Albers</a> said: "Being creative is not so much the desire to do something as the listening to that which wants to be done: the dictation of the materials." Don't forget to listen to your materials.

      Nauman</a> said "what makes the work interesting is if you choose the right questions." - what questions do you want to ask? BTW: <a href="http://www.newmedia-art.org/index_en.htm">newmedia-art.org is a great resource</a>.
  </div>
  <div>Some thoughts about practice.</div>
  <div>
    What is Practice? When I thought about it, it helped me alot. I like it because the word has many meanings, like many words. Repeating something all the time and what I like to do with my time. What meanings does it have for you? Have you heard it at UAL alot? What is a practice? What is your practice? What is the question that moves you at the moment? <a href="https://joelgethinlewis.com/presentations/SDEPresentationTheFuture2021/">My presentation about the future</a> (or my practice) that I gave to Samsung Design Europe this last year.

    Thanks! Time for a short break!
